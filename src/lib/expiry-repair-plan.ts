// FIX-007 / TASK-195 — recompute every course's `expiryDate` from the rule that should have set it.
//
// 🔴 **The dry-run list is the deliverable here, not the UPDATE.** Since the `EXPIRED` status shipped, a
// course's expiry decides whether a real family reads as finished on the owner's screen — so a repair that
// silently expires live families is the worst possible way to be technically right. This computes the change
// set and, separately, **who becomes EXPIRED the moment it commits**, so the owner reads that list of names
// before a single row is written.
//
// Pure — no DB, no clock. `today` is passed in (Bangkok, resolved by the caller).
