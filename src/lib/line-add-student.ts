// SPEC-071 / TASK-233 (REQ-079 §5 Flow 3) — เพิ่มนักเรียน: summary before write, nothing partial.
//
// 🔴 The three rules this file exists to make true, all of them pure so they are testable without a chat:
//
//  1. **The summary-and-confirm step is not optional.** This writes into a roster that has **no delete for
//     anything with history** — that is the product, not an oversight. Three seconds of review against a record
//     nobody can remove is cheap.
//  2. **A duplicate name asks for MORE DETAIL; it never demands a rename.** Two real children can share a name.
//     Telling a parent to rename their child is wrong — *and* it confirms to whoever typed it that such a child
//     exists. Asking for a surname or nickname gets the same outcome with no false claim and no leak.
//     ⚠️ This is @Porter's recommendation, not the owner's literal words (*"บอกให้ตั้งใหม่"*). If the owner
//     overrules it, only the message and AC-9 change — the machine below does not.
//  3. **Abandon halfway ⇒ nothing is written.** The draft lives on the session; the row is created at CONFIRM.
//
// Pure — no DB, no clock, no i18n side effects.

 * unchanged, because this is an input format and not a storage format. `null` when skipped.
 *
 * ## 🔴 TASK-277 (REQ-079 §17, closed by the owner 2026-09-06)
 * This matched **four-digit-year-first and nothing else** — the format the owner overruled. The customer
 * asked for day-first; the owner took their ORDER with our DASH.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The four-digit-first string is REFUSED, not reinterpreted — §17's own warning
 * *"The bot must still accept a 4-digit-first string and refuse it CLEARLY rather than read `2024-12-02`
 * as day 2024 and produce a confusing error."* ⇒ that shape is recognised and rejected, so the parent gets
 * the format sentence instead of *"day 2024 is not a day"*.
 * 🚫 **Both orders are NOT accepted.** If they were, `03-04-2024` would mean two different dates depending
 * on which rule fired — and there is no way for a reader to tell which one they got.
 *
 * ⚠️ `03-04-2024` is still genuinely ambiguous to a HUMAN — 3 April or 4 March. **What saves it is the
 * confirm step**, which prints the date back before anything is written. §17's words: that step is now
 * **load-bearing for correctness**, not merely for review.
 *
 * Deliberately strict otherwise: a birthdate that silently becomes the wrong date is worse than one nobody
 * entered, and this roster has no delete. A malformed answer re-asks rather than guessing a format.

 * ## Why this is not cosmetic
 * TASK-277 made the confirm step **load-bearing for correctness** because `03-04-2024` is ambiguous to a
 * HUMAN — 3 April or 4 March. The parser is unambiguous; the person is not, and the summary exists to let
 * them catch their own slip. ⇒ **echoing in the other order makes the reader perform exactly the conversion
 * the step exists to spare them.** On this field that is close to no guard at all.
 *
 * ## 🚫 It is deliberately NOT the inverse of `parseBirthDate`, and must never be used as one
 * The obvious future mistake is reaching for it to undo the parse. **The stored value stays ISO** — a
 * display format reaching the database is the one way this can do harm — and its only caller is
 * `summaryLines`, asserted by position rather than by a count so a fourth call site cannot slip past.
 *
 * ⚠️ A value that is not a well-formed ISO date **passes through unchanged**. Same rule as the phone
 * formatter: the display must not invent a shape for something it does not recognise.
